		- evaluates
			- software design patternsc
			- code implementation
			- problem solving
			- data structures and data processing
			- maintaining codebases via refactoring and encapsulation
		- evaluation
			- 1 language-agnostic, project-based task
			- 4 progressive levels that increase in complexity
				- at each level, new methods and entities are introduced
					- while retaining the integrity of previously implemented method contracts
					- ensures to completely change their existing implementations
					- required to refactor the code to replicate and iterate over a real-world scenerio
		- 4 levels
			- level 1 - initial design and basic functions
				- first level assesses general programming abilities and the use of basic data structures
				- implement 3-4 simple methods
				- includes
					- basic implementation (conditions, loops, type conversions, strings, etc.)
					- basic data structures (1-2D arrays, lists, hash tables)
					- covering corner cases
					- error handling
				- should exclude
					- advanced data structures
					- advanced implementation
					- any complex algorithms, problem solving, optimizations
			- level 2 - data structures and data processing
				- data processing functions, such as calculations, and aggregations, or exporting
				- while  assessing the ability to reuse code from level 1
				- focused on implementation skills, and does not require advanced algorithms, problem solving, or optimizations
				- 1-2 additional methods of medium difficulty
				- 20-30 minutes on this level, and
				- write 30-45 lines of code for both level 1 and level 2
				- includes
					- Intermediate implementation (data processing, statistical functions, etc.)
					- processing large streams of data (projection, filtering, aggregation, etc.)
					- advanced built-in data structures (counters, linked lists, sorted sets, etc.)
					- manipulate data representations based on commonly used formats (json, csv)
				- excludes
