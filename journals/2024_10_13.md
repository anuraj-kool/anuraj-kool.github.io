		- takeways
			- generative AI is more important to the industrial physical world than to the digital world
			- domain expertise is crucial for the industrial physical world.
			- generative ai agents can capture and apply domain expertise effectively
			- traditional methods for capturing domain expertise are often insufficient
			- america has an opportunity to leapfrog other countries in industrial ai
		- interesting insights
			- take open model + add your knowledge = do someone never possible before
				- e.g semiconductor
			- def of agent
				- task planning
				- solve complex problem
				- reasoning
				- reflection
				- action

			- digital twin of best domain expert
				- best of human ingunity
				- best of ai
			- hierarchal task planning
				- set goals
				- make plans
				- take actions
				- reflect and measure
				- adjust as necessary

- 02:41 [[notebooklm]] how to use it with youtube
	- make [[deepdive audio by notebooklm]] for any youtube video
		- makes existing talks more digestable for absorbing knowledge
		- question, answer brainstorming with critique and expert
		- makes great analogies
		- consistent and neutral form of consuming content

	- [EnCodec neural audio codec](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-powered-audio-compression-technique/) - audio tokenizer
		- lossy neural codec
		- compress any kind of audio and reconstruct the original signal with high fidelity
		- learn discrete audio tokens from the raw signal
		- which gives us a new fixed ‚Äúvocabulary‚Äù for music samples
		- train autoregressive language models over these discrete audio tokens
		- generate new tokens and new sounds and music when converting the tokens back to the audio space with encodec‚Äôs decoder
