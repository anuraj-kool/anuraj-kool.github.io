- how to deploy [[logseq]] graph as a single page webapp on personal site
	- download logseq locally
	- create a new graph linked to your laptop (optionally sync to dropbox, icloud or gdrive)
	- git init repo at graph location
	- git push to master to publish
	- use logseq spa github action to build a spa webapp using `master` graph data and deploy artifacts to `gh-pages` branch - https://github.com/logseq/publish-spa eg [this file](https://github.com/anuraj-kool/anuraj-kool.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml)
	- enable github page from your `gh-pages` branch
