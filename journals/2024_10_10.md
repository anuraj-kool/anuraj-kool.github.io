- 03:26 trends i am observing in new wave of GenAI startups as I engage with early stage founders
	- they are thinking about agents, for the right reasons
	- they were working on adjacent stuff before in core domain
	- they found agents disrupt and complement rote human workflows
	- they see a clear GTM and monetization framework that's modeled and estimated from economics of tasks in current market (like call center, agency, consulting)
	- the future looks agentic, this quote keeps resonating with me
